      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I am a Computer Engineering student at Iowa State University from
          Malaysia. My focus includes embedded systems, processor design, and
          secure web applications. Through technical projects and leadership
          roles as a Teaching Assistant, I have developed strong engineering
          fundamentals, ethical awareness, and professional communication
          skills.

      <h2>Career Objective</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          My goal is to become a responsible and technically fluent engineer who
          can design and build systems that create real-world impact. I am
          particularly interested in embedded systems, hardware-cloud
          integration, and intelligent infrastructure technologies. In the short
          term, I aim to gain strong hands-on industry experience in the United
          States to deepen my technical foundation and professional maturity. In
          the long term, I plan to return to Malaysia and contribute to the
          growth of engineering innovation and smart infrastructure development
          in my home country. I aspire not only to be successful in my field,
          but to earn respect through competence, integrity, and meaningful

      <h2>Senior Design – Smart Parking System 2.0</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Smart Parking System 2.0 is an AI-enhanced, vision-based IoT parking
          management platform designed for campus-scale deployment. The system
          integrates embedded edge devices, AI-based vehicle detection,
          cloud-hosted backend services, and a mobile application to provide
          real-time parking occupancy, navigation, and administrative oversight.
        </p>

        <h3>System Architecture</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Raspberry Pi edge devices performing AI inference using PyTorch
          </li>
          <li>Camera-based parking space and license plate detection</li>
          <li>Dockerized backend services using Spring Boot</li>
          <li>Reverse proxy configuration for secure campus access</li>
          <li>MySQL database for persistent storage</li>
          <li>React Native mobile application for users and administrators</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>
          As part of the hardware organization and component interaction team, I
          work on embedded system integration, edge device coordination, and
          ensuring reliable data transfer between Raspberry Pi units and backend
          services via HTTP protocols. I contribute to system-level debugging,
          hardware setup, and validation of real-time parking data transmission.
        </p>

        <h3>Engineering Skills Developed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Edge AI deployment constraints on embedded hardware</li>
          <li>Hardware–cloud system integration</li>
          <li>Containerized backend deployment (Docker)</li>
          <li>Distributed system coordination</li>
          <li>
            Collaborative engineering within a 7-member multidisciplinary team
          </li>
          <li>Client communication and requirement adaptation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact and Contribution</h3>
        <p>
          The project advances a prototype into a campus-ready intelligent
          parking infrastructure. By combining AI vision, IoT sensing, cloud
          services, and mobile navigation, the system demonstrates scalable
          smart-city technology capable of reducing search time and congestion
          while improving user experience.

      <h2>General Education Reflection</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Although I completed my general education coursework in Malaysia prior
          to transferring, communication studies had the greatest impact on my
          development as a person and engineer. As someone who was naturally
          introverted, I initially found public speaking and presentations
          challenging. Through structured communication training, I learned how
          to organize ideas clearly, express technical concepts effectively, and
          present confidently in front of an audience.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 15px">
          These skills have directly influenced my performance in engineering
          courses, team projects, and leadership roles as a Teaching Assistant.
          Strong communication has allowed me to collaborate effectively,
          explain complex technical topics, and contribute meaningfully within
          multidisciplinary teams. This foundation continues to shape how I
          approach both technical and professional challenges.

      <h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          When I first began my engineering journey, I was technically curious
          but personally reserved. English is my second language, and adapting
          to a new academic environment in the United States required
          resilience, discipline, and persistence. Over time, I strengthened not
          only my technical foundations in embedded systems, architecture, and
          software development, but also my confidence in expressing ideas
          clearly and professionally.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 15px">
          Through demanding coursework, high-pressure projects, and leadership
          responsibilities as a Teaching Assistant, I developed greater
          maturity, adaptability, and mental resilience. Working under stress
          improved my problem-solving ability and taught me how to remain
          composed in challenging situations. I learned to collaborate
          effectively within diverse teams and communicate technical ideas
          clearly, even when navigating language barriers.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 15px">
          Throughout this journey, I also gained a deeper understanding of
          ethical responsibility in engineering. Technical solutions must
          consider public safety, data privacy, sustainability, and societal
          impact. I’ve come to realize that strong engineering isn’t just about
          technical correctness, but also about accountability and long-term
          impact. The challenges I faced did not limit me, they strengthened me
          into a more confident, responsible, and capable engineer.
